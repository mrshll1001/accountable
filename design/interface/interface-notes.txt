Analysis of They Work For You - thoughts and notes.

GENERAL:
 - Search function via Postcode:
  Is this translatable? What would you search by? Charity category, name, funding maybe?


MP PAGES:
  Prompts to ask people how they would use the information.
    Potentially after they hit the download link instead of automatically like on TWFY. Give people a chance to actually read the data.

  Selection of Votes
    Project List section should cover this. Serves basically the same functionality.

  Recent appearances
    In the media? Funding Campaigns? Press Office?

  RSS feeds
    (projects? Funding?)

  Expenses data (Spending spread? Admin vs Project based spending?)
    These links take you to the Parliamentary Standards site, where you can look up the MPs and get the information in a .xls file (believe this is word)
    In adaptation, want to provide an open-data API to request data - already got the download in standard formats, maybe use a live feed? How to implement?

  Previous MPs in the constituency
    Maybe show charities / organisations that do similar work? This could be too broad, e.g. 'rare diseases' work could be various charities focusing on specific diseases.
    Previous projects by charities that have worked in this area?

  Numerology
    Quite good. At the moment my site design is mainly numbers, and an important note is that 'numbers do not imply quality'. Maybe a disclaimer on site saying that not all projects require intense funding?
    They do compare (in plaintext) w/ other MPS. .e.g '28 debates, above average for MPs'. This could be quite interesting to see how charities would compare themselves to others.

  Register of Interests.
    Would be cool to codify projects ourselves, then automatically generate the interests of the charities; see how they react?
